# tidyverse-stickers
Assembled some tidyverse packages hexbins into a tidyverse sticker. The hexbins were pbtained at https://hexb.in/ and assembled using https://www.draw.io/. This repository is composed by all svg files used in the sticker and the sticker itself in png, svg and html formats. If you want to tweak it a little or make your own version, you can open the html file in the draw.io site.
